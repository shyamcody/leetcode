# leetcode
Hi! on quest of learning c++ for high-performance computing, I have started practicing c++ questions from LeetCode.<br/>
I will add my solutions to the questions in this repo, as well as, you will get the question link also for most of the questions.<br/>
My solutions are btw, no way the "best" solution possible, but more on the reverse.<br/>
This repo is created in wish to:<br/>
(a) help you choose problems if you are also just beginning.<br/>
(b) to create one repo containing my c++ tricks and solutions.<br/>
